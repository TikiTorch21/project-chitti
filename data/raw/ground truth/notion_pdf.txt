What is GenAI?                          You give the AI some data, and using
                                        that data, that AI gives you whatever 
                                        you ask it for. Main thing to know is 
                                        that it ºs a field.

What is CHATGPT?                        A revolution that almost transformed 
                                        the way we interact with computers. 
                                        What are some of it's capabilities?
                                        -Web browsing
                                        - Advanced data analysis
                                        - Image processing
                                        - Voice interaction

What are the differences between        
ChapGPT, GPTs, and LLMS?                - Large language models that 
                                        basically understand and generate 
                                        natural language.
                                        - GPT's are a type of LLM.
                                        - ChatGPT is the application built on 
                                        GPT's

What is Natural Language
Processing?                             It's a field of the idea of computers 
                                        being able to understand language. 
                                        Divided into 3 main categories:
                                        1. Things like machine translation
                                        2. Things like human senses
                                        3. Things like text-to-speech and 
                                        automatic speech recognition

What is next word prediction?           Given a sequence of words, find the 
                                        next words. Essentially chooses the 
                                        next word in a sentence just by 
                                        filtering words with the highest 
                                        probability of occurring, and 
                                        choosing the top result.

What is N-Gram language?                First early rendition of language 
                                        models in the pre-deep learning era 
                                        Problems?
                                        1. Seed text might not exist in the 
                                        training data
                                        2. Exact phrasing might not exist. 
                                        Talked about Neural networks..(don't need to know for class)
