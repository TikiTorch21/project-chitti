This goal of this project is to build a RAG tool using Streamlit that allows users to upload documents and interact with them using a 'chatbot'. This project will take advantage of LLM's to retrieve relevant information from uploaded documents and general coversational responses.

<u><b>How it works:</b></u>
1. Uses Streamlit to create a UI for the user to upload a pdf
2. Ask the chatbot a question related to the pdf uploaded
3. Watch as the LLM pulls text from the uploaded pdf to answer the user query!
	- Also adds citations

<u>What does the Streamlit UI include specifically?</u>
	So far, it includes a:
	<pre>
	- File upload section
	- Chat window
	- Export answer
	</pre>

What are some <u>non-functional features?</u>
1. Peformance
	- Quick resolution of user queries and support for documents up to 10 MB.
2. Portability
	- Package the tool as a local application runnable on any system. 
3. Documentation
	- Provide comprehensive user and technical documentation. 
	- User guide: Steps to upload documents and interact with the tool.
	- Developer guide: Setup, codebase architecture, etc.
